# üßë‚Äçüç≥ AI Chef - Recipe Generator

This Streamlit application allows users to generate custom recipes based on ingredients they have, along with their dietary preferences, desired cuisine style, and meal type. The recipes are generated using Google's Gemini AI model.

## Features

- **Dynamic Recipe Generation:** Leverages the Gemini AI (specifically `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`) to create unique recipes.
- **Customizable Inputs:**
  - Main ingredients (comma-separated).
  - Meal type (Dinner, Lunch, Breakfast, etc.).
  - Cuisine style (type any cuisine, or leave blank for no preference).
  - Dietary preferences (Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, None, etc.).
  - Cooking skill level (Any, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
  - Desired total cooking time (minutes, optional).
- **Detailed Recipe Output:** Generated recipes include:
  - Creative Recipe Name
  - Enticing Description
  - Prep Time, Cook Time, Total Time
  - Servings
  - Ingredients list (with measurements, categorized if needed)
  - Optional Equipment list
  - Numbered Preparation Steps (with temperatures and timings)
  - Serving Suggestions
  - Optional Chef's Tips
- **Meal Planning:**
  - Generate weekly meal plans based on your preferences
  - Save and manage meal plans
  - View meal plan history
  - Export meal plans to PDF
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Clean layout with inputs in the sidebar and recipe display in the main area.
  - Loading spinners and success/error messages for better user experience.
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- **Session State Management:** Remembers and displays the last generated recipe within the current session until a new one is created.
- **Recipe History with Delete Option:**
  - The sidebar displays a list of all previously generated recipes, loaded from the `recipe_history.json` file. History is persistent across sessions.
  - Advanced filtering and search by name, ingredient, cuisine, meal type, or diet.
  - Each recipe in the history has a delete (üóëÔ∏è) button next to it. Clicking this button will permanently remove the recipe from the history and update the file.
  - You can click a recipe name to view it again in the main area.

## üåç Multi-Language Support

- **Recipe Language Selection:** Choose the language for recipe generation (English, Spanish, French, German, and more coming soon).
- **View/Export in Any Language:** Instantly translate and view/export recipes in your preferred language. The UI provides quick selection for English, Spanish, French, and German, but the translation engine supports additional languages (e.g., Urdu, Hindi, Chinese) for export.
- **Unicode PDF Export:** All recipe text (including CJK, Urdu, Hindi, etc.) is exported to PDF using the included DejaVuSans.ttf font for full Unicode support.
- **Font Setup:**
  - The app requires `DejaVuSans.ttf` in the project directory for Unicode PDF export. Download it from [dejavu-fonts.github.io](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) if not present.

## ü•ó AI-Powered Nutritional Analysis

- **Automatic Nutrition Info:** Each recipe includes an AI-estimated nutritional breakdown (calories, protein, fat, carbs, fiber, sugar, sodium, cholesterol, etc.).
- **Multi-Language Nutrition:** Nutritional analysis is provided in your selected language.
- **History Nutrition:** View nutrition info for any recipe in your history.

## üì§ Export & History Features

- **Download as PDF or TXT:** Recipes (both generated and from history) can be exported in any language, with correct Unicode rendering in PDFs and TXT files.
- **Recipe History:**
  - All recipes are saved in `recipe_history.json` (not committed to git).
  - Advanced filtering and search by name, ingredient, cuisine, meal type, or diet.
  - Delete recipes from history with one click.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling & Dependencies

- **Recipe Generation Errors:** If recipe generation fails, the app provides suggestions and error messages to help troubleshoot (e.g., check API key, internet connection, or try different ingredients).
- **Translation/Nutrition Fallbacks:** If translation or nutrition analysis fails, the app displays a warning and continues gracefully.
- **Dependencies:**
  - `googletrans==4.0.0-rc1` for translation
  - `fpdf` for PDF export
  - `DejaVuSans.ttf` for Unicode PDF support

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Contribution

- **Branch Naming:**
  - For multi-language and PDF features: `feature/multilang-unicode-pdf-export`
  - For nutrition features: `feature/nutritional-analysis-multilang-pdf`
- **Commit Messages:**
  - Use short, descriptive messages (e.g., `add nutritional analysis to PDF export`, `fix Unicode PDF for Chinese`)
- **Files to Commit:**
  - `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.MD`
  - Do **not** commit: `recipe_history.json`, font cache files (`DejaVuSans.cw127.pkl`, `DejaVuSans.pkl`)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages. If not, create one with at least:
   ```txt
   streamlit
   python-dotenv
   google-generativeai
   googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
   ```
   Then install:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you can install them directly: `pip install streamlit python-dotenv google-generativeai`)
4. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:
     ```env
     GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
     ```
   - **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your API key.
     ```gitignore
     .env
     .venv/
     __pycache__/
     ```

## How to Run the Application

1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if you created one):
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Or, if you are using a different environment, activate it as appropriate for your OS.
2. **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (if it does not already exist).
   - Add the following line to your `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your real Gemini API key:
     ```env
     GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
     ```
   - **Note:** You must have a valid Gemini API key from Google. If you do not have one, visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your key.
   - Make sure `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` so your API key is not committed to version control.
3. **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already):
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```powershell
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   If you encounter an error like `'streamlit' is not recognized`, try:
   ```powershell
   python -m streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. **Open your browser** and go to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
6. **Usage:**
   - Enter your main ingredients, select your preferences (including skill level and cooking time), and click "‚ú® Generate Recipe".
   - The AI-generated recipe will appear in the main area of the app.
   - When first opened or after clearing everything, the app displays a usage guide to help you get started.

## API Key Requirements

- The application requires a valid Google Gemini API key to function.
- You can obtain your API key from the [Google AI Studio API Key page](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
- Place your API key in the `.env` file in the root directory of the project, like so:
  ```env
  GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"
  ```
- **Important:** Do not share your API key or expose it in public repositories. Keep it secure and treat it like a password.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Recipe generation fails:**
  - Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.
  - Check your internet connection.
  - Try using different or fewer ingredients.
  - Reduce the complexity of dietary preferences or cuisine style.
- **Translation or nutrition analysis fails:**
  - These features rely on external services and may fail if the service is down or if there are network issues.
  - The app will continue to function, but with limited features.
- **PDF export issues:**
  - Ensure `DejaVuSans.ttf` is present in the project directory.
  - Check file permissions and available disk space.
  - For Unicode issues, make sure the font cache files (`DejaVuSans.cw127.pkl`, `DejaVuSans.pkl`) are not corrupted.
