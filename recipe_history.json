EQUIPMENT: Large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven\n\n9. PREPARATION STEPS:\n\n    1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).\n    2. **Marinate the Lamb:** In a large bowl, combine all marinade ingredients with the lamb.  Mix well, cover, and let marinate for at least 30 minutes (or longer, for deeper flavor).\n    3. **Sauté Vegetables:** Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the oven-safe pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and bell peppers and cook for another 3-5 minutes.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed.\n    7. **Finish the Tagine:** Once the lamb is cooked, stir in the fresh cilantro.\n    8. **Serve:** Spoon the saffron rice onto plates, top with the lamb and vegetable tagine.\n\n10. SERVING SUGGESTIONS:\n\n    Serve the tagine hot, garnished with extra fresh cilantro and a sprinkle of paprika.

CHEF'S TIPS:\n\n    * For a richer flavor, brown the lamb cubes in a pan before adding them to the tagine.\n    * You can substitute other vegetables you prefer, such as eggplant, potatoes, or green beans.\n    * Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  The flavors will deepen even further!\n\n",
